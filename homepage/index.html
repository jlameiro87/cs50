            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for
            HBO.
            It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of
            which
            is A Game of Thrones. The show was both produced and filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
            Filming locations also included Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.
            The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019,
            with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.
        </p>
        <p class="p-padding">
            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plots and a large
            ensemble
            cast and follows several story arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a
            web
            of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for
            independence
            from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled
            and
            is plotting a return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood
            defending
            the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.

            Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base.
            The series was acclaimed by critics for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values,
            although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) was criticized; the final
            season
            received further criticism for its condensed story and creative decisions, with many considering it a
            disappointing conclusion. The series received 58 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series,
            including
            Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo
            Awards
            for Best Dramatic Presentation (2012–2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe
            Award
            for Best Television Series – Drama (2012 and 2015–2018). In 2019, the show's final season established a new
            record
            for most Emmy nominations received in the same year by any regular series with 32, breaking the 25-year-long
            record
            of 26 nominations established by NYPD Blue in 1994; it also established Game of Thrones as the drama series
            with
            the most overall Emmy nominations, with a total of 161.
